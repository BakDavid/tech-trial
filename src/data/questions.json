    "question": "What is the time complexity of searching in a balanced binary search tree?",
    "options": ["O(n)", "O(log n)", "O(n log n)", "O(1)"],
    "answer": "O(log n)",
    "explanation": "In a balanced BST, the height is log n, so searching takes O(log n) time as we eliminate half the tree at each step."

    "question": "Which data structure uses LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle?",
    "options": ["Queue", "Stack", "Array", "Linked List"],
    "answer": "Stack",
    "explanation": "Stack follows LIFO principle where the last element added is the first one to be removed."

    "question": "What is the best case time complexity of Quick Sort?",
    "options": ["O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n²)", "O(log n)"],
    "answer": "O(n log n)",
    "explanation": "Quick Sort has O(n log n) best and average case complexity when the pivot divides the array into roughly equal halves."

    "question": "What is horizontal scaling?",
    "options": ["Adding more power to existing servers", "Adding more servers to the pool", "Increasing database size", "Optimizing code performance"],
    "answer": "Adding more servers to the pool",
    "explanation": "Horizontal scaling means adding more servers to handle increased load, as opposed to vertical scaling which adds more power to existing servers."

    "options": ["To encrypt data", "To allow cross-origin requests", "To compress files", "To cache resources"],
    "answer": "To allow cross-origin requests",
    "explanation": "CORS is a security feature that allows web pages to make requests to a different domain than the one serving the web page."

    "question": "What is the main advantage of a linked list over an array?",
    "options": ["Faster access time", "Dynamic size", "Less memory usage", "Better cache performance"],
    "answer": "Dynamic size",
    "explanation": "Linked lists can grow or shrink during runtime, while arrays have a fixed size in most languages."
